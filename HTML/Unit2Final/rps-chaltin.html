<!-- Rock Paper Scissors API

At http://codyhess.com:9001 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. , there is an API that will take 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' as the first argument in its path. It will accept a name as the second argument in its path. Given one argument, the API will return a JSON object with the results of a single "Rock, Paper, Scissors" match against a computer opponent. Given both arguments, the API will return a JSON object with the results of a single match, as well as the total wins, losses, and ties in the entire history of matches for that name.

API documentation and hints are available at the base endpoint (link).

You may use the API with fetch() or XMLHttpRequest().

Use the API and the files rps-<yourname>.html, rps-<yourname>.css, and rps-<yourname>.js to build a page that meets the following specifications.

HTML

    has header "Rock, Paper, Scissors
    has a text input field with attribute placeholder=" enter a name"
    has a button "play rock"
    has a button "play paper"
    has a button "play scissors"
    has a paragraph with text "user chooses:"
    has a paragraph with text "computer chooses:"
    has a paragraph with text "result"
    has an empty paragraph with attribute id="tWin"
    has an empty paragraph with attribute id="tLose"
    has an empty paragraph with attribute id="tTie"

JavaScript

    clicking "play rocks", "play paper", or "play scissors", will:
        call the API with an appropriate first argument (rock, paper, or scissors)
        if there is user input in the text field, use that as a second argument to the API
        the API response is converted to a JSON object
        the response data is displayed appropriately in the paragraphs
        if there is no input to the text field, the final three paragraph elements are empty
        if there is a name in the text field, the final three paragraphs say:
            "Total Wins: X"
            "Total Losses: Y"
            "Total Ties: Z"
            Replace X, Y, and Z with appropriate data from the API response.

CSS

    page has grey background
    content is centered
    buttons are below the input field (you can use HTML for this)
    font for all elements is Bubblegum Sans
