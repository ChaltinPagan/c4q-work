<!-- CONVERSION API

At http://codyhess.com:9000, there is an API that converts numbers to base-2 (binary), base-10 (decimal), and base-16 (hexadecimal). API documentation and hints are available at that link.

Use the files conversion-<yourname>.html, conversion-<yourname>.css, and conversion-<yourname>.js to build a page that meets the following specifications:

HTML

    has a header with text "Number Base Converter"
    has a text input field
    has a button "convert from binary"
    has a button "convert from decimal"
    has a button "convert from hexadecimal"
    has a paragraph with text "Original Number:"
    has a paragraph with text "Original Base:"
    has a paragraph with text "As Binary"
    has a paragraph with text "As Decimal"
    has a paragraph with text "As Hexadecimal"

JavaScript

    clicking any button uses the API to fetch appropriate conversions for the number in the input field
        all paragraph elements are updated with appropriate data
        the input field is emptied

CSS

    all text uses the font "Nunito" (you will have to import this)
        this includes button text and the text input field
    buttons are below the input field (this can be done with HTML) 
    the "Original Number" and "Original Base" paragraphs have a smaller font than the other 3 paragraphs
    the header is underlined

Upload conversion-<yourname>.html. -->
